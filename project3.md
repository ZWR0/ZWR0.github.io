Balancing computational expense and predictive precision, this work employs machine learning to predict yields in Pd-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig amination. It assesses the efficacy of product extended molecular fingerprints and select physicochemical properties as key descriptors. Insights into reaction mechanisms suggest heavier atoms in aryl halides benefit outcomes.<br>

In this context, HTE refers to High-Throughput Experimentation, a method used in chemistry and biology to rapidly conduct multiple experiments in parallel. The Buchwald-Hartwig C-N cross-coupling reaction is a chemical reaction used to form carbon-nitrogen bonds, often employed in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other complex organic molecules. AATSC4m could be a specific parameter or descriptor related to this type of reaction or experimental setup.<br>

This sentence describes a process where predictive modeling is used to forecast the outcomes (yields) of chemical reactions that are pertinent to a particular design or study, and these predictions are then used to inform and direct experimental work.<br>
