  The Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have shown remarkable performance in various tasks within the domain of chemistry. However, a common drawback of neural network models lies in their interpretability; studies that provide explanations for these models tend to be rather superficial and lack depth. This work plans to construct a GNN model capable of accurately capturing the deep information of interactions between molecules, with the aspiration to offer more profound mechanistic insights into different chemical reactions.

  A reaction graph represents a visual or abstract structure that captures the relationships and transformations between reactants, products, and intermediates in a chemical reaction. This graphical representation allows machine learning models to better understand and predict the mechanisms and outcomes of chemical reactions by encoding the connectivity and changes at the molecular level.

    In this scenario, the GNN model is tailored to operate on the specific structure of the reaction graph. It is trained to identify and understand the latent connections and transformations within chemical reactions by leveraging the graph's topology and node features, which represent atoms and bonds. Through this process, the GNN can capture complex interactions and patterns that are crucial for predicting reaction outcomes or designing new chemical processes.

 Google Colab (short for Collaboratory) is a cloud-based development environment provided by Google that includes support for machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. It allows users to write and run Python code through notebooks, and it also provides access to powerful computing resources like GPUs and TPUs, which can significantly speed up the training process of machine learning models.
