The Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have shown remarkable performance in various tasks within the domain of chemistry. However, a common drawback of neural network models lies in their interpretability; studies that provide explanations for these models tend to be rather superficial and lack depth. This work plans to construct a GNN model capable of accurately capturing the deep information of interactions between molecules, with the aspiration to offer more profound mechanistic insights into different chemical reactions<br>

In this context, HTE refers to High-Throughput Experimentation, a method used in chemistry and biology to rapidly conduct multiple experiments in parallel. The Buchwald-Hartwig C-N cross-coupling reaction is a chemical reaction used to form carbon-nitrogen bonds, often employed in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other complex organic molecules. AATSC4m could be a specific parameter or descriptor related to this type of reaction or experimental setup.<br>

Further exploration of the reaction mechanisms reveals that the presence of heavier atoms in the aryl halides may have a beneficial impact within the examined Pd-catalysed Buchwald-Hartwig amination reactions.<br>
