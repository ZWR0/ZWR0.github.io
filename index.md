# About Me

<img src="https://zwr0.github.io/picture1.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Weiren Zhao** (**èµµä¼Ÿä»»**).

I completed my undergraduate studies at Qingdao University of Science and Technology. Currently, I am in my third year as a Masterâ€™s student under the supervision of Associate Professor [Li Yang](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/yangli/zh_CN/index.htm)ðŸ”— at Dalian University of Technology. My research focuses on machine learning modeling to predict chemical reaction yields, designing targeted catalysts, and employing DFT calculations to understand transition metal catalysis mechanisms. As a 2025 graduate, I am actively seeking connections with research groups that integrate ML and DFT calculations. My future plans include furthering my education and expertise in these interconnected fields.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *32227015@mail.dlut.edu.cn*

Balancing computational expense and predictive precision, i employs machine learning to predict yields in Pd-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig amination and reveals heavier atoms in the aryl halides may have a beneficial impact on the examined Pd-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig amination reactions.

You can find detailed introductions to the relevant research findings in **Project One**, **Project Two**, and **Project Three** at the top of the page.
